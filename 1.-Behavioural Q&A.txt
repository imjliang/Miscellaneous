Q1. Describe a stressful situation at work and how you handled it.

"Recently, we lost an important member of our team at short notice. The reasons for him leaving were not made clear to us;
however, the impact on the team was significant. He had been helping us to implement a new important working strategy within the 
organisation and to replace him was going to be difficult. People within the team started to panic as we only had 4 weeks left in which to 
complete the new project."
