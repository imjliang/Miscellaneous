1. How do I force "git pull" to overwrite local files?
It's worth noting that it is possible to maintain current local commits by creating a branch from master before resetting:
	git checkout master
	git branch new-branch-to-save-current-commits
	git fetch --all
	git reset --hard origin/master
After this, all of the old commits will be kept in new-branch-to-save-current-commits.
